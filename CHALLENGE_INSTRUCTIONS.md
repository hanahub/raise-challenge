This is a partially-written React app built atop a stock `create-react-app` codebase. Look it over and finish it to the best of your ability. There is no time limit, but engineers typically spend ~2-3 hours on it. When you're done, upload the project to Github and send us the link.

This is a low-pressure challenge; feel free to use whatever resources you like. We want to see an example of your very best work, so take your time and show us what you're capable of.
